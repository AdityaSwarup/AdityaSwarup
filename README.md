ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdityaSwarup. I'm a Pure Mathematics and Philosophy minor student at the University of Waterloo and I love doing research projects.
My most recent project is Atlas, a solution dedicated to connecting the world. Atlas takes multiple user locations as an input, and ouputs a centroid of those locations, while also returning a list of things to do around the centroid. On this project, I worked on the front-end development and the mathematics behind the algorithm.
