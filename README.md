ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AdityaSwarup. I'm a Pure Mathematics and Philosophy minor student at the University of Waterloo and I love doing research projects.
I'm currently working on a SQL project analysing and contrasting pandemic data between Covid-19 and SARS, H1N1, and Ebola.
Always open to collaborating with people on any interesting project ideas :)
